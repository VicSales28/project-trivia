# Trivia Master 🔠

This project was developed by the team: [Victoria Sales](https://github.com/VicSales28), [Linda Inês](https://github.com/lindainesv), [Pedro Montandon](https://github.com/pedroMontandon), [Camila Gonçalves](https://github.com/CamilGon), Josiane Oliveira, while we were studying Redux in React Applications at Trybe Programming School. 

We have developed a quiz game based on the Trivia game. This application allows the user to:

- Log in to the game and, if the email is registered on the Gravatar website, have your photo associated with the user's profile.
- Access the page referring to the game, where you must choose one of the available answers for each of the questions presented. The answer must be marked before the time counter reaches zero, otherwise the answer must be considered wrong.
- Be redirected, after 5 answered questions, to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of correct answers.
- View the ranking page, if you want, at the end of each game.

Regular deadline: March 29, 2023 at 2:00 pm

  <summary><strong>🔎 Linter</strong></summary><br />

To ensure code quality, the `ESLint` and `Stylelint` linters were used in this project.

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

* ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
* ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
* ESLint is completely 'pluggable', each of the rules is a plugin and you can add […]

To run them locally, run the commands below:
`npm run lint`
`npm run lint:styles`
